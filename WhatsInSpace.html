        What Are Satellites, How Many Are There, and What Purpose Do They Serve?
      </h1>
      <!--<p class="text-gray-300 text-sm ml-16 mr-16 mb-16"> (Source: https://www.nasa.gov/)</p>-->
      <h2 class="text-white text-2xl mb-8 ml-16 mr-16 font-lato">
        What Are Satellites?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-white mb-8 ml-16 mr-16 font-lato">
        Technically speaking, a satellite is a moon, planet or machine that orbits a planet or star. However, the term
        usually refers to a piece of technology launched into space that revolves around Earth.
        <br><br>
        Thousands of such man-mad, or "artificial" satellites are currently in orbit, serving us in numerous ways - taking
        pictures, predicting weather patterns, assisting communications such as television or phone calls, and even for
        location services, like GPS.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-white text-2xl mb-8 ml-16 mr-16 font-lato">
        Why Are Satellites Important?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-white mb-8 ml-16 mr-16 font-lato">
        A satellite's altitude and perspective allows them to see vast amounts of the Earth at one time. This means that
        they can collect much more data, much more quickly, than we can on the ground.
        <br><br>
        A satellite's altitude also allows them to see better into space than regular telescopes on the Earth's surfact
        because they fly above clouds, dust, and other molecules in the Earth's atmosphere than can often block our view
        from the ground.
        <br><br>
        Before satellites, TV signals could not travel very far because they travel in straight lines and quickly travel
        off into space rather than following the Earth's curvature. Additionally, they can be blocked by mountains or tall
        buildings. Phone calls to faraway places also faced similar problems, for example, setting up telephone wires over
        long distances or underwater is very difficult and expensive.
        <br><br>
        With satellites, however, TV signals and phone calls can be sent upward to a satellite. Then, almost instantly,
        the satellite can reflect the signal to send them back down to different locations on Earth without such
        interference.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-white text-2xl mb-8 ml-16 mr-16 font-lato">
        What Are the Parts of a Satellite?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-white mb-8 ml-16 mr-16 font-lato">
        Satellites are built in many shapes and sizes depending on their function, but have at least two important parts
        in common - an antenna and a power source. The antenna is what allows the satellite to send and receive
        information, often to and from Earth. The power source can be a solar panel or battery. Solar panels make power by
        turning sunlight into electricity.
        <br><br>
        Many satellites also carry cameras and scientific sensors. Sometimes these instruments point toward Earth to
        gather information about its land, air and water. Other times they face toward space to collect data from the
        solar system and universe.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-white text-2xl mb-8 ml-16 mr-16 font-lato">
        How Do Satellites Orbit Earth?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-white mb-8 ml-16 mr-16 font-lato">
        Satellites are launched into space on rockets, and begin to orbit the Earth when their speed becomes balanced with
        the pull of Earth's gravity. Without this equilibrium, the satellite would fly in a straight line off into space
        or fall back to Earth. Satellites can orbit Earth at different heights, different speeds and along different
        paths. The two most common types of orbit are "geostationary" and "polar."
        <br><br>
        A geostationary satellite travels from west to east over the equator. It moves in the same direction and at the
        same rate Earth is spinning. From Earth, a geostationary satellite looks like it is standing still since it is
        always above the same location.
        <br><br>
        Polar-orbiting satellites travel in a north-south direction from pole to pole. As Earth spins underneath, these
        satellites can scan the entire globe, one strip at a time.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-white text-2xl mb-8 ml-16 mr-16 font-lato">
        Why Don't Satellites Crash Into Each Other?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-white mb-8 ml-16 mr-16 font-lato">
        Actually, they can. NASA and other U.S. and international organizations keep track of satellites in space.
        Collisions are rare because when a satellite is launched, it is placed into an orbit designed to avoid other
        satellites. But orbits can change over time. And the chances of a crash increase as more and more satellites are
        launched into space.
        <br><br>
        In February 2009, two communications satellites - one American and one Russian - collided in space. This, however,
        is believed to be the first time two man-made satellites have collided accidentally.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-white text-2xl mb-8 ml-16 mr-16 font-lato">
        How Does NASA Use Satellites Today?
      </h2>
      <p class="text-white mb-16 ml-16 mr-16 font-lato mb-20">
        Satellites help scientists study Earth and space.
        <br><br>
        Satellites looking toward Earth provide information about clouds, oceans, land and ice. They also measure gases in
        the atmosphere, such as ozone and carbon dioxide, and the amount of energy that Earth absorbs and emits. And
        satellites monitor wildfires, volcanoes and their smoke.
        <br><br>
        All this information helps scientists predict weather and climate. The information also helps public health
        officials track disease and famine; it helps farmers know what crops to plant; and it helps emergency workers
        respond to natural disasters.
        <br><br>
        Satellites that face toward space have a variety of jobs. Some watch for dangerous rays coming from the sun.
        Others explore asteroids and comets, the history of stars, and the origin of planets. Some satellites fly near or
        orbit other planets. These spacecraft may look for evidence of water on Mars or capture close-up pictures of
        Saturn's rings.
