                    Astronauts certainly stay busy during their time on the space station. There are many ongoing experiments at a time, and the crew also has to ensure that the station is well maintained, meaning they spend a lot of their time testing, repairing, or replacing equipment. Crew members are also required to exercise for two hours per day in order to stay fit and keep their body in shape to fight against the natural atrophy that occurs in zero-gravity.

                    ISS missions, or expeditions, typically last around six months. There are always at least three to six crewmembers on board to ensure proper maintenance as well as disaster prevention. Professional crews come from the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada, and Europe, but we have also seen other nations represented in the graphic above. The longest NASA expedition lasted 215 days by Mike Lopez-Alegria. Russian cosmonaut, Valeri Polyakov, spent a much longer 437 days in space during a single mission.

                    How Long Do You Have To Train Before You Fly In Space?
                </h2>
                <p class="text-white mb-16 font-lato">
                    Astronauts are in constant training for space flight. The intial process involves learning about basic ISS systems, going on space walks, and operating the robotic arm. You continue this training throughout the waiting period for the next assignment. Once an astronuat is details to a flight, more specific training for the mission at hand proceeds. This can take as long as three years. The length of this training depends on how complicated the mission tasks are. ISS missions also require that you speak Russian, which adds additional time to the training process.

                    What Effects Does Space Flight Have On Your Body?
                </h2>
                <p class="text-white mb-16 font-lato">
                    Astronauts' bodies adjust to space in many ways. Immediately upon entering zero gravity, the fluids in your legs and lower part of your body moves upwards towards your head. Feelings of a swollen head or face are frequent within the first days. That said, except for the occasional headache and congestion, the effects of this fluid shift is relatively mild. These feelings often go away as the astronaut adjusts after a few days, after which, nearly everyone is properly adjusted to the new environment. In terms of physical fitness, if you do not exercise, your bones and muscles will get weak. This is the primary reason astronauts are required to work out daily. Upon return to Earth, it also takes time to readjust and feelings of dizziness occur. Again, bodies adapt to new environments in different ways.

                    What Kind Of Food Do Astronauts Eat?
                </h2>
                <p class="text-white mb-32 font-lato">
                    Astronauts bring several types of food when traveling in space. Most of the food has already been cooked and processed, and has been freeze dried and vacuum sealed. These pre-packaged meals can then be prepared by adding water and heated in a small oven in space.
